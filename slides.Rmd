## Background

- The Information Services Division (ISD) of the National Health Service (NHS) Scotland produces around 200 official and national statistics publications each year.
- Traditional publication output is a **static pdf document** with accompanying **excel tables**.

```{r out.width = "50%", fig.align = 'center'}
include_graphics(here::here("images", "pdf_report.png"))
```


## Traditional publication process

```{r out.width = "70%", fig.align = 'center'}
include_graphics(here::here("images", "traditional_process.png"))
```

- Complex (many steps between software)
- Prone to error
- Manual, menial tasks carried out by highly skilled people
- Not reproducible or sustainable


## The solution 
```{r out.width = "60%", , fig.align = 'center'}
include_graphics(here::here("images", "rap_matts.png"))
```

[RAP companion](https://ukgovdatascience.github.io/rap_companion/)

Combined the principles of **reproducible research** with **data science tools and best practice**.

Basic principle is using one open-source piece of software for entire production process, from data extraction to final report.


## What is a RAP project?

- No (or few) manual steps = data and output produced using code
- High quality and auditable = version control
- Sustainable = peer review
- "Bells and whistles" = _functions, documenting/testing these functions, package management and computing environment_

```{r out.width = "60%", fig.align = 'center'}
include_graphics(here::here("images", "rap.jpg"))
```

## What is a RAP project?

```{r out.width = "100%", fig.align = 'center'}
include_graphics(here::here("images", "new_process.png"))
```

## Case study: HSMR


## Levels of RAP/automation
```{r, echo = FALSE}
kable(automation_levels,
      col.names = c("Level", "Description"),
      format = "markdown")
```
