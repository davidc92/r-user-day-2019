# Create data frame for levels of automation table
automation_levels <- data.frame(
  c(1:3, c("4a", "4b"), 5:7),
  c("Ad hoc R code",
    "R project",
    "R project under version control (VC)",
    "R project under VC and peer reviewed (wrangling)",
    "Replicable report in Rmarkdown (publication)",
    "Near RAP (as above plus data quality assurance and package management)",
    "Full RAP (as above plus unit testing and documentation)",
    "R package"))
```


## Background

- The Information Services Division (ISD) of the National Health Service (NHS) Scotland produces around 200 official and national statistics publications each year.
- Traditional publication output is a **static pdf document** with accompanying **excel tables**.

```{r out.width = "50%", fig.align = 'center'}
include_graphics(here::here("images", "pdf_report.png"))
```


## Traditional publication process

```{r out.width = "70%", fig.align = 'center'}
include_graphics(here::here("images", "traditional_process.png"))
```

- Complex (many steps between software)
- Prone to error
- Manual, menial tasks carried out by highly skilled people
- Not reproducible or sustainable


## The solution

```{r out.width = "60%", , fig.align = 'center'}
include_graphics(here::here("images", "rap_matts.png"))
```

[RAP companion](https://ukgovdatascience.github.io/rap_companion/)

Combined the principles of **reproducible research** with **data science tools and best practice**.

Basic principle is using one open-source piece of software for entire production process, from data extraction to final report.


## What is a RAP project?

- No (or few) manual steps = data and output produced using code
- High quality and auditable = version control
- Sustainable = peer review
- "Bells and whistles" = _functions, documenting/testing these functions, package management and computing environment_

```{r out.width = "60%", fig.align = 'center'}
include_graphics(here::here("images", "rap.jpg"))
```


## What is a RAP project?

```{r out.width = "100%", fig.align = 'center'}
include_graphics(here::here("images", "new_process.png"))
```


## Case study: HSMR




## [Levels of RAP/automation](https://www.isdscotland.org/About-ISD/Methodologies/_docs/Reproducible_Analytical_Pipelines_paper_v1.4.pdf)

```{r, echo = FALSE}
kable(automation_levels,
      col.names = c("Level", "Description"),
      format = "markdown")
```


## Scaling RAP

- The [Transforming Publishing (TPP)](https://www.isdscotland.org/Products-and-Services/Transforming-Publishing-Programme/) team have begun to roll out RAP to other teams in ISD using a buddy system

- One or two members of TPP 'buddy up' with another team to help them create a Reproducible Analytical Pipeline for their publication

- As a minimum, we recommend teams aim for level 4 (a or b or both) as laid out in our [RAP paper](https://www.isdscotland.org/About-ISD/Methodologies/_docs/Reproducible_Analytical_Pipelines_paper_v1.4.pdf)
